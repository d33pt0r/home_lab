# Home Lab with QEMU on Ubuntu Server
Running a home lab on an old laptop using Ubuntu Server and QEMU for efficient virtualization.
## Introduction
<div align="justify">I set up my home lab on an old laptop to make better use of available hardware. To maximize performance for the virtual machines, I chose Ubuntu Server instead of Ubuntu Desktop. This document walks through the steps I followed to install Ubuntu Server, configure QEMU, and create my first KVM. It also explains how I set up remote access to both the server and the virtual machine, making it possible to manage the environment from anywhere, including on a smartphone.</div>

## Objectives
+ Install Ubuntu Server
+ Setup SSH connection
+ Install QEMU
+ Install Kali Linux KVM
+ Setup Remote Desktop Access to the Kali KVM
